 * Merged in pull request from rssh. This adds javascript generation and
	refactors the compile thrift into a method.

[0.3] 10.27.2011
 * Changed the thrift command to use ! rather than Process(cmd).run()
	because it looks like Process run will run the process in a
	different thread. This was causing some java files not to be
	compiled in the first call to compile.

 * Initial release
